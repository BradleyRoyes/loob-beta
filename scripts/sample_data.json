    "content": "The Viscereality Project innovatively combines breathwork and virtual reality to induce altered states of consciousness. At its core is a bio-responsive VR application that dynamically adapts to users' breathing patterns. This approach aims to couple interoception (internal bodily awareness) with exteroception (perception of the external world) by synchronizing immersive virtual environments with breathing techniques such as circular breathing and hyperventilation. By blurring the boundaries between internal physiological states and external virtual contexts, the project seeks to facilitate a dissolution of the sense of self - a key characteristic of altered states. This novel method explores how the interplay of bodily sensations and responsive digital environments can influence consciousness, potentially offering new insights into subjective experiences and opening avenues for therapeutic applications in mental health.",
